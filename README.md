<h1 align="center">ADD, Sligo Intranet</h1>

[View the live project here.]( https://bridcourtney.github.io/project-1-employee-site-hub/)

The ADD, Sligo Employee Intranet, will give Visitors immediate access to our internal business.  The concept of the Intranet is to advance and build awareness of the business to which we all contribute to. 

The site will be hosted on SharePoint.  Each Department will have a page.  Department Page design will be streamlined and always carry the site header, footer and navigation Bar for consistency.  

Business Teams will have the opportunity to host their SharePoint document Libraries & lists e.g the 'IDEA' & 'Good Catch' initiatives. The EHS, Risk Management and many more teams can share information and updates.  The Workspace dropdown will contain links to common applications, websites etc.  The 'Contact Us' link will provide users an opportunity to provide feedback and suggestions.

The Sign Up button in the Site Vision area currently links to Our CARE Program, next month there will be a new promotion.  Once the User clicks on the submit button the SharePoint list for the particular promotion will be updated with the persons email. 

It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for employees.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   Color is fundamental in the way we express the Abbott brand. The color palette I used includes, Dark Blue in the                           header and footer of each page.  I used Light Grey as a Neutral Colour in the 'What Our People say' section.  In the                     'Our Site' section I included Gold to give the Site energy.  I also used Gold for the 'CARE Program' button on the main                 Page for a splash of colour.
            The Site Background colour is White, it acts like a blank stage that draws attention to the Site Content.  The vibrant                      color Gold, the imagery used and typography really ‘pop’ out against a white background.

    -   #### Typography.
        -   The 'Josefin Sans' font is the main font used throughout the whole website with sans-serif as the fallback font in case for             any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. The 'Josefin Sans'gives the Site an unified appearance                    throughtout 
    -   #### Imagery
        -   I selected imagery that was not posed or contrived. No images that are treated or stylized.  My images share a common thread                of humanity, greatness and authenticity. Images that depict- 
           - ###### People living in the moment (person snowboarding on Montain Top, Girl Free Floating in water 'Contact Us' page).
           - ###### People engaged in an activity (Cyclying Team).
           - ###### Concepts that go beyond what is actually depicted (View blue sky through white Pergola).
           - ###### Engaging scenery that entices the viewer (Satellite view of river delta).

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a New Visitor, I want all my commonly used app links in one place a ‘Hub’, so much time will be saved

         1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page            of their choice.  In this case the user is looking for the Workspace Dropdwon that contains a list of commonly used apps &             websites

    2. As a New Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

        1. The site contains the workplace Vision and Behaviours.  The 'Our Site' section give New visitor an overview of their new                   workplace

    3. As a New Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page            of their choice. Each page in the site will have an uniform header, footer and Navigation Bar that will intutively bring the User          where they wan to go

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to update Teams files. Add that great Idea I have to the IDEA form, and maybe win some Time in            Lieu for my effort 

        1. All Team can be easily found under the Team dropdown
      

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to Sign Up to the latest HR Inititive e.g. CARE Program, Heart Foundation Presentation etc

        1. Sign Up to various Initiatives will be available on the Home Page in the Our Vision section

.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check the EHS Page for Latest Covid 19 updates.

        1. The EHS Page will be available from the Navigation Bar with all the latest updates

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to submit Suggestion from the 'Contact Us' page

        1. Link to the Contact Us page is available from the Home Page, User can easily navigate bach to HomePage on completion

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to check my Team files for new assignments and required approvals.
    
        1. Historically file e.g. excel etc were located on shared drives and updated by Team.  In Office 365 file sharing is not                   meeting Customer Satisfaction and has led to data loss.  Therefore SharePoint Document list and Library Webparts offers                 Teams a Safer more reliable altenative
        

     
### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer & Microsoft Edge.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   On small mobile devices the vision container touches the top of the Navigation Bar.
-   In the Behaviours container I wanted to concatenate the Behaviour with the icon, I did not have time to complete this requirement.        Therefore on some screens the Behaviour may not have the icon beside it, because it is on the line above
